##  Datasets
### BRACS
Introduced by Brancati et al. in [BRACS: A Dataset for BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping in H&E Histology Images](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/bracs-a-dataset-for-breast-carcinoma)

A  new dataset of hematoxylin and eosin histopathological images for automated detection/classification of breast tumors .Include 547 labeled Whole Slide Images,4539 labeled Regions of Interest,189 patients.

BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (**BRACS**) dataset, a large cohort of annotated Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained images to facilitate the characterization of breast lesions. BRACS contains 547 Whole-Slide Images (WSIs), and 4539 Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted from the WSIs. Each WSI, and respective ROIs, are annotated by the consensus of three board-certified pathologists into different lesion categories. Specifically, BRACS includes three lesion types, i.e., benign, malignant and atypical, which are further subtyped into seven categories.

### TNBC
Introduced by https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/tnbc

Inolves an annotated a large number of cells, including normal epithelial and myoepithelial breast cells (localized in ducts and lobules), invasive carcinomatous cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, macrophages and inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and plasmocytes). In total, our data set consists of 50 images with a total of 4022 annotated cells, the maximum number of cells in one sample is 293 and the minimum number of cells in one sample is 5, with an average of 80 cells per sample and a high standard deviation of 58. The annotation was performed by three experts: an expert pathologist and two trained research fellows. Each sample was annotated by one of the annotators, checked by another one and in case of disagreement, a consensus was established by discussion among the 3 experts.

### NuCLS
Introduced by https://sites.google.com/view/nucls/home

The NuCLS dataset contains over 220,000 labeled nuclei from breast cancer images from TCGA. These nuclei were annotated through the collaborative effort of pathologists, pathology residents, and medical students using the Digital Slide Archive. These data can be used in several ways to develop and validate algorithms for nuclear detection, classification, and segmentation, or as a resource to develop and evaluate methods for interrater analysis.
Data from both single-rater and multi-rater studies are provided. For single-rater data we provide both pathologist-reviewed and uncorrected annotations. For multi-rater datasets we provide annotations generated with and without suggestions from weak segmentation and classification algorithms.
For more details consult our GigaScience paper, or contact us directly with questions.
